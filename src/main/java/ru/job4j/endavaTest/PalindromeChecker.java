/*
Implement method checkIfPalindromes(List<String> words) so that it will
return list of booleans which is result of test if word is palindrome*;

*A palindrome is a word which reads the same backward as forward;

Example:

Input: [Madam, programmer, cIVic];

Output: [true, false, true]

Note: You should check if word is palindrome ignoring the case, so that
for "cIVic" result should be true as well as for "civic" or "CIvic";
